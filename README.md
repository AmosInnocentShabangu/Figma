## Description
Peer Link” is designed for South African learners in under-resourced schools, remote areas, or
without reliable internet, who need accessible, relatable learning.
Our platform is a mobile application that connects students who need help with those who can
teach them, crating peer learning communities that meet in local spaces like church halls and
libraries.
Unlike traditional tutoring or expensive e-learning platforms, Peer Link is community-driven, low-
cost, and works both online and offline, ensuring no learner is left behind due to connectivity
issues.
Our product helps close South Africa’s education gap by proving that our greatest resource for
solving the education crisis isn’t expensive technology-it’s our own students helping each other
